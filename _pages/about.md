I feel this is very importent, this is only a fansite.
I try to get a collection going of all Cobi Toys (mostly there WW2 Models)

For this purpose i found it nice to have a website that got all of the models on it.

The Images are mostly from there site cobitoys.de or from Amazon.

**Features**

- Cobi toys with there catalog number
- Amazon.de links
- cobitoys.de links
- Images of the Box

**Disclaimer**

**The links to Amazon are affiliate links, this means if you buy from Amazon after visiting by using my links i get some money. You do not pay more but it keeps me motivated and helps with covering Cost for this site.**

- I have nothing to do with the polish firm that makes these great and cool models
- If they want me to stop, just a word is enough and i will take down the site!
- I'm mostly doing this out of FUN and because i like the product.
